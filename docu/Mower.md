The HPG solution can be easily fitted to a lawn mower to test the performance.

The scooters from BOSCH can be easily hacked to extract the Hall sensor signals that are used as a distance sensor by the ZED-F9R WT input. Most likely the three Hall sensors signals can be tapped in on the Green, Purple and Gray wires on the two motor connectors. In addition Black and Red may be GND and 3 or 5 volts. The other three thicker wires are likely the three thicker phases for the Motor. This is just a guess for now from the image here but will be verified.
