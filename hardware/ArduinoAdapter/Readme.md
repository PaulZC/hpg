# Arduino Adapter Board

This is an adapter for replacing the ArduSimple board in the [Open Mower project](https://github.com/ClemensElflein/OpenMower) by [Clemens Elflein](https://github.com/ClemensElflein/OpenMower/commits?author=ClemensElflein) with this project or a XPLR-HPG-2.

**Remarks**
- The Yellow marked pin headers are mounted on bottom side to provide connection to the Open Mower board.
- The Purple marked pin headers are mounted on top side and connect to the HPG board.
- All other pin header signals are not connected, but can be mounted for mechanical stability. 
- When powering the board in this way do not connect a battery as this is used to inject supply from the Open mower board.
